# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data. It allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city around the world.

## Features

- Retrieves current weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays temperature, weather description, and other relevant information for the selected city.
- Utilizes Unsplash for fetching background images based on weather conditions.
- Built following the tutorial [Build a Weather App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI&t=1446s).
- Documentation references: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

## Usage

To use this app, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for, and press the "Search" button. The app will then display the current weather information along with a relevant background image.
